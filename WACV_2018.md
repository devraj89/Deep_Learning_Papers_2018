List of papers I find to be useful from WACV 2018 

[1] [Identity-preserving Face Recovery from Portraits : 

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8354122

-- might be useful to disentangle representations

-- here it seems like they are removing the styles from potraits to match with face images (supratim?)

[2] Weakly Supervised Facial Attribute Manipulation via Deep Adversarial Network

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8354123

-- given a source input image and reference images with a target attribute, our goal is to generate a new image (i.e., target
image) that not only possesses the new attribute but also keeps the same or similar content with the source image

-- idea can this network in figure 2 be used to train GAN to generate features with specific attributes ? I am not talking about the face images but suppose like text/image data features and you need to have this set of attributes... can it generate a set of attributes ? instead of a single attribute only ?

[3] A Generative Approach to Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Action Recognition

[4] Learning Disentangled Multimodal Representations for the Fashion Domain

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8354171

-- from the paper "... In many visual domains (like fashion, furniture, etc.) the search for products on online platforms requires matching textual queries to image content. For example, the user provides a search query in natural language (e.g.,pink floral top) and the results obtained are of a different modality (e.g., the set of images of pink floral tops). Recent work on multimodal representation learning enables such cross-modal matching by learning a common representation space for text and image. While such representations ensure that the n-dimensional representation of pink floral top is very close to representation of corresponding images, they do not ensure that the first k1 (< n) dimensions correspond to color, the next k2 (< n) correspond to style and so on. In other words, they learn entangled representations where each dimension does not correspond to a specific attribute. We propose two simple variants which can learn disentangled common representations for the fashion domain wherein each dimension would correspond to a specific attribute (color, style, silhoutte, etc.). ..."

[5] Iterative Cross Learning on Noisy Labels

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8354192

-- divide the data into two random sets and using a clean monitoring set interplay the predictions between the two network to clean the noisy data

-- given for single modality, a heuristic algorithm

[6] Neural Algebra of Classifiers

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8354189

-- might be useful for few shot learning

-- from the paper "
