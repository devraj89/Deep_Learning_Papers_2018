[1] Zero-Shot Learning with Attribute Selection
--------------------------------------------------------

https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/download/16350/16272

-- a very interesting paper showing the importance of attributes in ZSL

-- but only deals with seen train categories ... how to incorporate the unseen also on the fly ?

-- deep model incorporation ? how ? 

-- similar related paper from years back in ECCV 2012

[2] Binary Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Retrieval
--------------------------------------------------------

https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17150/15712

-- an interesting paper basically their attribute to generate the  figures are discrete in nature

-- also looks like you can basically have a control over what amount of similarity you wish to give 

-- perhaps can be used to generate attributes for the zsl on the fly and help in better attribute generation ?

[3] Partial Multi-View Outlier Detection Based on Collective Learning
--------------------------------------------------------

https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17166/15700

-- an interesting problem

-- basically detection of attributes across modalities (but also with the possibility of missing data)
