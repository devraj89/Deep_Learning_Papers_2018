[1] Memory Replay GANs: learning to generate images from new categories without forgetting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7836-memory-replay-gans-learning-to-generate-new-categories-without-forgetting.pdf

-- learn two generate new categories without forgetting

-- potentially solving the problem of incremental learning 

-- possible extensions to few shot learning/ zero shot learning / etc

[2] Generalized Zero-Shot Learning with Deep Calibration Network
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7471-generalized-zero-shot-learning-with-deep-calibration-network.pdf

-- uses entropy but they require to know the category names of the unseen categories during the training itself

-- entropy used during training (in our case it is different)

[3] Out-of-Distribution Detection using Multiple Semantic Label Representations
